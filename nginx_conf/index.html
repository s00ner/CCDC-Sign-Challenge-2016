<title>Hack This Sign Challenge</title>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to the challenge.</h1>
<p>There is a LED sign on Unallocated Space's table. Your goal is to change the text on that sign. If you can do it, you win a prize.
<br><br>
Guidelines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't do anything destructive: no denial-of-service, deleting files, attacking other wireless clients.</li>
<li>Don't bother attacking the wireless router(10.0.0.1), it will get you nowhere.</li>
<li>If you are stuck, ask for a hint. You might not get one, but asking never hurts.</li>
<li>You are welcome to work as a team but only one prize will be awarded to the team.</li>
<li>Don't let other people cheat off of your hard work. You're better than that.</li>
<li>If you have successfully hacked our sign, come to the table to claim your T-shirt.</li></ol>
